          <h1>Why Did Mithridates Poison Himself Daily With Small Doses?</h1>
          <p>
            <strong>Imagine preparing for assassination attempts by sipping poison like tea.</strong> King Mithridates VI of Pontus treated toxins as daily armor to stay one step ahead of his enemies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Why would a monarch risk constant stomach pain for a hypothetical attack?

          <h2>Context</h2>
          <p>
            The Black Sea kingdom of Pontus sat between Rome and rival Hellenistic powers, meaning Mithridates grew up watching enemies eliminate relatives with poison, including his own father Mithridates V in 120 BCE (Source: Plutarch, <em>Life of Sulla</em>).
          </p>
          <p>
            By the time Mithridates seized full control in 113 BCE, he faced hostile courts, Roman expansion, and internal conspiracies that made chemical assassination a daily risk (Source: Adrienne Mayor, <em>The Poison King</em>, 2009).

          <h2>Main Point 1: Immunity as Counterintelligence</h2>
          <p>
            Mithridates micro-dosed toxins so even if a servant switched his cup, the poison would underperform, buying time to identify traitors (Source: Appian, <em>Mithridatic Wars</em>).
          </p>
          <p>
            This applies to most cases, though not all, because some fast-acting alkaloids can overwhelm any tolerance if the dose is high enough.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section className="section">
          <h2>Main Point 2: Scientific Curiosity and Data</h2>
          <p>
            Court physicians cataloged toxins, antidotes, and dosages in clay tablets, effectively building one of antiquity&apos;s earliest pharmacological libraries (Source: Galen, <em>On Antidotes</em>).
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2020 the World Health Organization estimated 5.4 million people suffer snake bites annually, showing how widespread venom threats remain even today (Source: World Health Organization, 2020 Snakebite Envenoming Fact Sheet).
          </p>
          <p>
            And in my experience as a history writer, reading Galen&apos;s notes feels surprisingly methodical, almost like modern lab notebooks.

        <section className="section">
          <h2>Main Point 3: Ritualized Routine</h2>
          <p>
            Daily dosing let Mithridates rehearse danger, reinforce loyalty, and project invincibility to allies and foes alike (Source: Adrienne Mayor, <em>The Poison King</em>, 2009).
          </p>
          <p className="highlight">
            <strong>He turned poison into a ritual with three repeating steps:</strong>
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Test a known antidote on a food item before eating.</li>
            <li>Drink a measured blend of snake venom, hemlock, and opium in diluted wine.</li>
            <li>Log bodily reactions with physicians to adjust the next dose.</li>
          </ol>
        </section>

        <section className="section">
          <h2>Main Point 4: Political Messaging</h2>
          <p>
            Surviving toxins let Mithridates craft the legend that even death could not touch him, an idea Roman generals feared because it suggested their plots would fail (Source: Sallust, <em>Histories</em> Fragment 4).
          </p>
          <p>
            That myth inspired loyalists who believed the king was favored by the gods, though historians caution that exaggerated claims circulated alongside the reality of frequent illness.

          <h2>Real-World Example</h2>
          <p>
            Modern snake venom researcher Tim Friede publicly self-immunizes with diluted cobra and mamba venoms, and a 2017 National Geographic report noted his antibody levels allowed him to survive controlled bites that would otherwise be lethal (Source: National Geographic, 2017, &quot;The Man Who Injects Snake Venom to Build Immunity&quot; by Simon Worrall).
          </p>
          <p>
            His regimen highlights both the promise and peril of mithridatism, especially because medical observers recorded episodes of nerve damage despite rising immunity.

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            Mithridates consumed poisons daily because they let him neutralize assassins, test antidotes, and amplify his mystique, but even he nearly died when a Roman plot forced him to flee without his remedies (Source: Plutarch, <em>Life of Pompey</em>).
          </p>
          <p>
            If you&apos;re studying ancient resilience, take these lessons as a reminder to build systems that balance experimentation with safety checks, and always consult modern medical experts before mimicking historical practices.
